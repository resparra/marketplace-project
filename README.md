# Introduction

The project will consist of building a prototype version of a Medical Provider Marketplace where people can find a doctor or other healthcare provider to book an Appointment with. People should be able to search the marketplace for Providers. They should also be able see a list of all medical Providers. Finally, they should be able to select a provider and submit a request for an Appointment with the Provider.

# User Stories

- As a patient, I want to see a list of all health providers in the Marketplace.

- As a patient, I want to search for health providers in the Marketplace by name.

- As a patient, I want to search for health providers in the Marketplace by specialty.

- As a patient, I want to select a provider to book an appointment with.

- As a patient, I want to fill in my information for the appointment request, including my preferred time and day, and be able to submit the request.

- As a new provider, I want to submit a request to be added to the Marketplace.


# Getting Started

The project is divided in two main components, backend and frontend. The backend is build is Django Framework used to build a REST Api to manage the data storage. An administration system is included for admin user to manage and approve provider submissions. The frontend is build in React as a single page application to search providers, request new provider and create appointments for a specific provider.

# BACKEND

To run the backend locally is recommended to create a virtual environment.

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv

# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

With the virtual environment activated we can install all the required python libraries. To install all dependencies run:

```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once inside the the backend folder the database must be initialize by running

```
python manage.py migrate
```

This will generate a new SQLite database with all the data structure necessary to run the application.

###### OPTIONAL (recommended)

There is a data dump names ```test-data.json``` that can be imported to populate the database with usable data and a default superuser. To load the data run

```
python manage.py loaddata test-data.json

# user : admin
# pass : default2020

```

To create a new superuser you can run the create super user command and follow the instruction.

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### LOCAL SERVER

To run a local server use the command
```
python manage.py runserver
```

To run tests use the ```python manage.py test```


# FRONTEND

The frontend consist on a single page application build in React. To run the application locally is required to have installed ```nodejs``` and ```yarn```. To install the required dependencies run yarn in the frontend folder.

```
cd frontend
yarn
```

To be able to communicate with the backend make sure that API_URL is configured with the backend domain.

```
vim marketplace/src/utils/constants.js
# var API_URL = "http://localhost:8000";

```

To run the local server run ```yarn start``` from the ```marketplace``` folder and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser. Tests can be run using ```yarn test```
